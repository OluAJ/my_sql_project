# my_sql_project
This is my final project on the Introduction to Data &amp; SQL course. Submitted on August 22, 2023.

This is focused on the creation of an Entertainment based database with the purpose of data analysis for better decision making.

## What The Project Does
- The project creates a _**Database**_ called `Entertainment` which is a relational database
- Within Entertainment, _**5 tables**_ were created called `Appearances`, `Cast`, `Categories`, `Countries`, `Media` with relationships established
  - Data partially sourced from kaggle and built-up by myself and normalized
  - This also includes the EER Diagram which provides a pictorial view of the tables and their relationships
- The project also creates a _**view**_, _**stored procedure**_ and _**stored function**_
- The code within the project demonstrates the ability to query, pull out specific data for the purpose of further analysis and decision making.
